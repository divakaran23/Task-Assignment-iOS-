Task-Assignment-iOS-
====================
Created an iOS app to manage different tasks with respect to their date and time. 
Implemented a tableview to show all the user’s task in a single page along with the respective color codes denoting whether completed, overdue or yet to be completed. 
Allowed the user to create new task, edit old task, delete task, and change the task’s completion time and color code.
Color codes:-
Green = Completed;
Yellow = Not completed (due);
Red = Overdue
